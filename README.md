# Vehicle_Control_System
The C programming project implemented a Vehicle Control System that allowed users to interact with functionalities such as engine control, sensor simulation, and environmental management. The system provided a user-friendly console interface for selecting options to turn the engine on or off, simulate sensor readings, and manage vehicle parameters.
